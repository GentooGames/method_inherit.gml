# method_inherit.gml
a custom gamemaker script to implement method_inheritance

# credit
original method-inherit concept created by Gleb Tsereteli
expanded and extra features added by _gentoo_

# how-to-use
method_inherit can be used to inherit the logic of a previously defined method of the same name in an object.
this implementation does not preserve "static" functionality, and should primarily be used for methods declared in gml.objects.
